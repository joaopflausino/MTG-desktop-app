# MTG desktop app
This software was made with the magic the gathering API you can check the link [here](https://github.com/MagicTheGathering/mtg-sdk-java).\
It is still being built little by little so don't expect any major changes just yet,this project is for my university and it`s used primarily to learn about .txt and binary files. propably in the future it will have a connection to a database as well using Postgres. \
to see the full documentation about the API and how it works go to [magicthegathering.io](https://magicthegathering.io) .
